# Multi-Objective OMT(QF_LRA) benchmarks

Original publication:  


These benchmarks include multi-objective optimization in LRA from [1].

The benchmarks are contained into one folder:

- symba-box [1]: benchmarks obtained from the benchmarks used to evaluate the SYMBA optimizer.
  The original problems are multi-objective optimization problems, where each cost variable is both minimized and maximized.
  Here, they are translated into multi-objective box-optimization problems.
